# Auto

## Notes
1. Given a user-defined operator== and operator< for objects of type T, implements the usual semantics of other comparison operators.
2. As of C++20, std::rel_ops are deprecated in favor of operator<=>.
3. So 'using namespace std::rel_ops;' are no longer recommended.
4. Instead what we need to do is include the templates in the header such as my_utility.h
