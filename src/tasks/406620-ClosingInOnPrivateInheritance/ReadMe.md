## Notes
1. The class that does private inheritance is really selfish. Take a look at the following.

![PersonHierarchy](50_50_Person_Hierarchy.jpg)

2. Here the Engineer inherits person privately. So the engineer class has inherited members from person and now these members are private because of private inheritance of its base class. 
3. m_3 will stay private in the eyes of Engineer. Which means engineer class cannot access m_3
4. Private inheritance is going to constrain what you can forward down what parent class is providing.
