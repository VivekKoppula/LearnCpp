## Notes
1. This example is similar to the earlier examples. Here we are comparing two differnt scenarios. First the inline keyword. Then we have static keyword.

2. Build and Run. We see the following. When using inline, the address is same. For static the address is different.

```txt
age(utility1) : 
age  : 12
&age : 0x7ff68df330c0
age(utility2) :
age  : 12
&age : 0x7ff68df330c0
----
distance(utility1) :
distance : 23.9
&distance : 0x7ff68df30010
distance(utility2) :
distance : 23.9
&distance : 0x7ff68df30020
```
