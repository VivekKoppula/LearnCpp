# Some weird stuff.

## Notes
1. Some weird stuff.
2. To do.
3. Notice here the type of result 1 and 2 are of integer which are of 4 bytes. 
4. What we need to understand here is when we add two short int, we cannot get the result in short int. 
5. What we get is int instead, which is of 4 bytes.
6. The compiler automatically casts into an inteager instead of short int. 
7. This is because of the limitation of computer arch. 
8. They cannot add two short ints. If they have to add, then must convert into int and then add them.  		
9. Addition operation is supported by int(4 bytes) or greate types(greater then 4 bytes) but not short int.
