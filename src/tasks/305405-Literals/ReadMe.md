# Literals

## Notes
1. No Video found.
2. Literals represent constant values directly in code.
3. Literals are constant values assigned to variables that remain fixed and unmodifiable throughout the programâ€™s execution.
4. Unlike variables, literals are not associated with references and directly hold their values in memory.
5. In common usage, the terms `constants` and `literals` are often used interchangeably.
6. These constants can include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more. 

```cpp
const int x = 5;
```

Here, value 5 is a constant integer literal.

7. Integer Literal: Used to represent whole numbers, such as 42.
8. Float Literal: Represents decimal numbers with a fractional part, like 3.14.
9. Character Literal: Represents a single character enclosed in single quotes, such as 'A'.
10. String Literal: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, like "Hello, World!".
11. Boolean Literal (C++): Represents either true or false, indicating logical values in C++.
12. Literals are essential for initializing variables, specifying values in expressions, and conveying data directly within the source code. They provide a means to express concrete values without requiring variables or complex computations.
13. Literals play a pivotal role in coding by providing a concise way to embed fixed values directly into the source code.
14. In C++14, we can use binary literals by using the 0b prefix

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int bin{};        // assume 16-bit ints
    bin = 0b1;        // assign binary 0000 0000 0000 0001 to the variable
    bin = 0b11;       // assign binary 0000 0000 0000 0011 to the variable
    bin = 0b1010;     // assign binary 0000 0000 0000 1010 to the variable
    bin = 0b11110000; // assign binary 0000 0000 1111 0000 to the variable

    return 0;
}
```

16. 0x before the number means this is hexadecimal

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 0xF }; // 0x before the number means this is hexadecimal
    std::cout << x << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

17. Octal. 0 before the number means this is octal

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 012 }; 
    std::cout << x << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
