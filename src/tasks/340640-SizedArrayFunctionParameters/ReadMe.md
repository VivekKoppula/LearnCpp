## Notes
1. double scores[] and double scores[5] are same. Take a look at the following method declarations.

```cpp

double sum ( double scores[], size_t count){
    //
}

double summ ( double scores[5], size_t count){
    //
}

2. It does not matter double scores[] and double scores[5] or double scores[20]. The size is completely ignored by the compiler. 

```
