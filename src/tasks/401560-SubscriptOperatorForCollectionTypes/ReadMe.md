## Notes

1. We are going to have the ability to modify the data using a subscript operator.

2. We also have the ability to read the data using another subscript operator.

```cpp
double &operator[](size_t index);
double operator[](size_t index) const;
```

3. Const and non const operators. 

4. The const overload is necessary if we want a const object like the following.

```cpp
// Const objecst
const Scores geo("Geography");
```
